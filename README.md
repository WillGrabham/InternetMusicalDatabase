# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## How do I deploy this?

### PostgreSQL for Vercel Deployment

This project uses PostgreSQL as its database, which is compatible with Vercel's serverless architecture.

For local development:
```bash
# Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker
docker compose up -d

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

For deployment to Vercel:
1. Create a PostgreSQL database on Vercel or another provider
2. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your PostgreSQL connection string
3. Deploy your application

For other deployment options, follow the T3 deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel), [Netlify](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/netlify) and [Docker](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/docker) for more information.
